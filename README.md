# Project Management Form

## Description
This is a web-based **Project Management Form** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and integrated with **JsonPowerDB (JPDB)** using Talend API services. The form supports three primary operations:
- **[Save]**: Adds new project records.
- **[Update]**: Updates existing records based on Project ID.
- **[Reset]**: Resets the form to its initial state.

The form starts with only the Project ID field enabled. Based on whether the Project ID exists in the database, the appropriate buttons and fields are enabled.

### Features:
- Data is validated (no empty fields).
- Smart field control based on primary key existence.
- Clean UI using basic CSS.
- Designed for use in NetBeans (nbproject compatible).
